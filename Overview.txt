OVERVIEW
Draft version 0.1
2015-02-27


The requirements are taken from Zonemaster <https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster/tree/master/docs/specifications/tests>. The ID has been kept. The short form of the requirement has been updated, mostly slightly, but sometimes rewritten. 

Next step is to rewrite the requirements, and then Zonemaster will only be the source, not the reference.

Each requirement will have an outcome, which is PASS if the specification is met, or one of FAIL, WARNING, NOTE or NONE if the requirement is not met.

The outcome if the requirement is not met depends on two things:

1. The requirement can have a set of possible outcomes. E.g. some requirements will only have the possible outcome FAIL, others will have FAIL or WARNING, while a third example have WARNING or NOTE. There is always a default outcome.

2. If a requirement has more than one possible outcomes, then the local or individual policy decides which.


The short form of the requirement is written as a statement to make it clear what is to be met.
