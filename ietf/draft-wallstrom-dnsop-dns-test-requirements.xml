    <abstract>
    	<t>This document outlines a set of requirements on a well-behaved
    		DNS delegation. A large number of tools has been developed to
    		test DNS delegations, but all tools uses a different set of
    		requirements for what is a correct setup for a delegated
    		domain name. However, there are few requirements on how to
    		set up DNS in order to just make the delegation work. But in
    		order to have a well-behaved delegation that is robust to
    		failures and also make DNS resolvers behave normally, there
    		are a large number of things to consider.</t>
    	<t>Based on this document, it should be possible to create a set
    		of test specifications for how to test a DNS delegation.</t>

    	<t>text text exempelref (<xref target="RFC5730"/>)</t>
    	<t>The requirements are split into these different areas, to easier
    	differentiate between what they are for:</t>

    	<t><list style="numbers">
    		<t>Basic</t>
    		<t>Address</t>
    		<t>Connectivity</t>
    		<t>Consistency</t>
    		<t>Delegation</t>
    		<t>DNSSEC</t>
    		<t>Name server</t>
    		<t>Syntax</t>

    		<xref target="RFC2182"/>. The only exception is the root zone,
    		which do not have a parent zone.</t>
