# Test Requirements Task Force

The TRTF is a [CENTR](https://centr.org/) working group which aim is to
create a set of best current practices documents for evaluating the quality
of a DNS delegation.

One of the documents will be a list of requirements on a properly delegated
domain name. The first draft of the list of requirements can be found in
the [RequirementsList](RequirementsList.md) document.
